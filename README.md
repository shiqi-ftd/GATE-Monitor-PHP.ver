# GATE-Monitor-PHP.ver
This is a web interface project named GATE Interactive Monitor.

Based on the former works, there is a GATE Model of the Siemens Inveon Trimodal Imaging Platform. 
The purpose of this project is to provide a web interface for that.

This project provides end users with basic PET/SPECT simulation functions and easy access via web brower. 

The key features of using this interface includes:

Light weight: Given the central-server's interface, there's no need to install the whole system on local devices.

Portable: The end user could control and monitor the simulation everywhere at anytime if there is a Internet access.

Easy and Fast to set up: Given the simulation templates, it is much easier and quicker for the end to set up the simulation environment.

Detailed: Within each simulation template, the end user remains the freedom of setting up multiple parameters.
